What is Bails?

It's first and foremost easy to use, free, easy to setup and very private.

I believe it's extremely secure in relation to the effort it takes to setup and use. 
Nothing comes close since you get: isolated security focused free open-source OS, Strong encyption, Tor, verify signatures, Bitcoin Core full node, and a secret sharing style paper backup done all in under an hour. And it doesn't need a dedicated PC, just a dedicated USB stick.

The only options that match or come close in backup privacy in similar time span, don't even scratch the surface for anything else security critical and are more error prone. 

But it doesn't make the most secure setup possible yet, but that will come in the next version or two after testers give me feedback and tell me what they want to see next.

This would be appropriate for up to half a year's expenses. Life savings need multi-signature and offline signers.
