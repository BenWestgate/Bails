# Backup is simply a tails-backup command but it adds a file to the
# autostart directory that welcomes the user to their backup. Asks if
# they are testing the backup or recovering. If recovering, it will
# delete the autostart and prompt to update with the cloud. If testing
# it will keep the autostart and warn for backups older than a year
# that they should be tested at least once a year, ideally twice or
# quarterly. The file is removed after backup is complete.
