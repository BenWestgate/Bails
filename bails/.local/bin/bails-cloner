# priv keys, everything in ~/Persistent CipherStick didn't put there. After
# tar, it will assymmetrically encrypt with a random key with the
# public key dervived from the user's passphrase+share, this must be
# stretched as well as the original luks encryption was. Then the
# public key and original files are moved to /tmp, a
# first-run-clone.desktop is added to autostart, the device is backed
# up using a temporary random password creating a clone, then the
# originals are restored and the temporary password is displayed for
# the clone's owner to photograph or write down. Files then restored.
